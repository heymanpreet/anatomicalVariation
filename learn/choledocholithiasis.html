                  Pathology: Gallstone stuck in the common bile duct causing obstruction of bile flow from gallbladder and liver. Bile can become infected and spread into live. It may result in life threatening complications like biliary cirrhosis and pancreatitis.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Symptoms: Abdominal pain, fever, jaundice (yellowing of skin and eyes), loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, clay-coloured stools. Pain may suddenly build-up and be very severe. Can be mistaken for cardiac pain.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Ultrasound: Both longitudinal and transverse need to be carried out, looking at distal head of common bile duct as it passes through pancreatic head. Gallstone presence increases suspicion.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Treatment: MDT management involving radiologist, gastroenterologist, and surgeon. ERCP (Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) is the first line treatment. If the procedure is successful, most patient have same day cholecystectomy. This increases the difficulty of the procedure due to inflammation.
