    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of this app is to teach you about the gallbladder and common variations of the cystic duct and artery through a virtual 3D experience.
      Anatomical variations in the body are normal functioning structures, with unique morphological differences. However, research indicates that they may increase the risk of complications in various clinical procedures. This is likely due to the general unfamiliarity with such variations1. This app aims to raise this issue in context of a cholecystectomy, through an interactive simulation of the surgery.
