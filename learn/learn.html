      What is the gallbladder?
      The gallbladder is a green-toned pear-shaped organ that sits deep in the liver. Its purpose is to store and concentrate up to 50mL of bile.
      Bile is a yellow-brown fluid produced by the liver that contains enzymes to:
      <ul>
      <li>	Digest lipids (fats)</li>
      <li>	Neutralize gastric acid to prevent it from damaging the intestines</li>
      <li>	Remove toxins and waste</li>
      <li>	Inhibit bacterial growth in the small intestine</li>
    </ul>
      The gallbladder is 7-10cm long and 3cm wide and sits under the right lobe of the liver, extending from the porta hepatis.
      <br>
      The superior surface is attached to the liver with connective tissue and the rest, whilst not attached, is covered by a thin peritoneum membrane.
      <br>
      It is divided into 3 sections: The body, the fundus, and the neck. An important clinical feature is Hartmann’s pouch, a small protruding area at the neck of the gallbladder. Gallstones are often found here.
