    <h2>What is the gallbladder?</h2>

    <p>
      The gallbladder is a green-toned pear-shaped organ that sits deep in the liver. Its purpose is to store and concentrate up to 50mL of bile.
      Bile is a yellow-brown fluid produced by the liver that contains enzymes to:
      <br>
      <ul>
      <li>Digest lipids (fats)</li>
	    <li>Neutralize gastric acid to prevent it from damaging the intestines</li>
	     <li>Remove toxins and waste</li>
      <li>Inhibit bacterial growth in the small intestine</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The gallbladder is 7-10cm long and 3cm wide and sits under the right lobe of the liver, extending from the porta hepatis.
      The superior surface is attached to the liver with connective tissue and the rest, whilst not attached, is covered by a thin peritoneum membrane.
      It is divided into 3 sections: The body, the fundus, and the neck. An important clinical feature is Hartmannâ€™s pouch, a small protruding area at the neck of the gallbladder. Gallstones are often found here.
