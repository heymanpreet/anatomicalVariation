    <p><span>The cystic artery provides oxygenated blood to the gallbladder. It is one of the terminal branches of the coeliac trunk:
      <br>
      The cystic duct allows bile to pass in and out of the gallbladder. Bile is synthesised in the liver and drained into left and right hepatic ducts which continue as the common hepatic duct. This is joined by the cystic duct, and they continue as the common bile duct until the bile is emptied into the duodenum.
      <br>
      There are many different variations of the cystic artery and duct that can occur, and whilst these so not cause any problems for the individual, they complicate surgeries. There is an increased risk during surgery if the patient has one of these variants as the surgeon would first have to correctly locate the artery and duct before making incisions.
